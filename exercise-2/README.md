# Exercise-2

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

In the space below, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor.

See `complete` branch for answers.


| Course Number| Title                                  | Instructor   |
| :----------  | :------------------------------------- | ------------ |
